09:18 - Sabre One: I can think of two reasons
09:18 - Sabre One: one, me accidently deleting or interacting with a object why in "storage" could screw it up. As they really are just tp'd to a corner of the map. Another could be they are zues editable objects still, even stored.
09:20 - Tajin: well, if they're just moved to a corner, then they will certainly stay editable
09:20 - Tajin: but that shouldnt stop them from beeing taken out afterwards
09:21 - Tajin: http://rising.at/projekte/ArmA/R3F_LOG/config.sqf
09:21 - Tajin: lines 236 - 274
09:22 - Tajin: thats all you need to change to disable towing and lifting btw
09:23 - Tajin: ok it wont disable that part of the script completely but it'll be unusable
09:23 - Sabre One: Yea, I can leave that later. I just wan't to make sure it doesn't screw with advance towing/lifting
09:27 - Sabre One: Sol far things been going to plan though, still working on kinking out the revive system. Kinda/sorta works.
09:27 - Sabre One: Reparing doesn't seem to work in zues either, but I think that is a Bi glitch.
09:27 - Tajin: farooq ?
09:27 - Tajin: or which one is it ?
09:27 - Sabre One: Just messing with the vanilla one for now. It seemed to kick in but no one really used it today.
09:28 - Sabre One: Made it so only medics can revive :P
09:28 - Tajin: yeah well it has some flaws
09:30 - Sabre One: The trident fix works perfectly, we had a good "CSAT vs FIA" hostage session today.
09:30 - Tajin: cool
09:31 - Sabre One: I also been messing with getting rid of the Game mode module for zues all together as well. Only issue I had was it made players un-selectable in zues.
09:32 - Tajin: theres a module for that
09:32 - Tajin: editing players is off by default I think
09:33 - Sabre One: Well not editing per say, but simply seeing their icons in the zues editor.
09:33 - Tajin: ah ok
09:33 - Tajin: I usually script that
09:33 - Tajin: curatorAddEditableObjects :)
09:34 - Sabre One: nice, think you could write me up something? Getting rid of the "see lighting" silly objectives is so nice.
09:34 - Tajin: see lightning ?
09:34 - Sabre One: all the beginning objectives you normally do
09:34 - Sabre One: you get rid of all that without using the game mode module. Which is nice.
09:35 - Tajin: oh ok
09:35 - Tajin: the curator module ?
09:35 - Tajin: maybe we're talking of different things
09:35 - Tajin: dont remember what modules there are exactly
09:36 - Tajin: anyway you can create the following file just to be safe
09:36 - Tajin: initPlayerServer.sqf
09:36 - Tajin: and put this into it
09:36 - Tajin: params ["_player", "_jip"];
{
_x addCuratorEditableObjects [[_player], false];
} count allCurators;
09:36 - Tajin: that will make sure all players are editable by every zeus on the map
09:36 - Tajin: or... at least selectable
09:37 - Sabre One: Yea, thats all it matters. Cleans  up a lot of stuff for me.
09:39 - Tajin: its also possible to add new zeus on the fly
09:40 - Tajin: or make it so specific players get it automatically
09:40 - Tajin: based on their uid
09:40 - Sabre One: Yea I seen that done in servers. Here is a plot twist, can you do that with high command as well?
09:40 - Tajin: I guess so
09:41 - Sabre One: I mean you can simulate a lot of high command with zues, the issue I found if you want a player to have it for game purposes beyond GMing a session is they abuse the overhead camera.
09:41 - Tajin: true
09:42 - Tajin: same with the tactical camera that you get as squadleader...
09:42 - Sabre One: At least with high command, if your in charge of 3 squads you kinda just have to order them into a area and let them do their job. With or without a view on there position.
09:46 - Tajin: i guess it would also be possible to hide everything but the friendly units when you're in zeus
09:46 - Tajin: though that could be a bit weird
09:46 - Sabre One: Is it possble? From what I seen even if you can't see the icons. You can see the units still just moving around.
09:47 - Tajin: yes thats the default
09:47 - Tajin: but its possible to hide units completely
10:01 - Sabre One: ow
10:01 - Sabre One: ow
10:01 - Sabre One: almost forgot, a new request for a project.
10:02 - Sabre One: http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=21645 Can you get this to work? It's pretty outdated.
10:04 - Sabre One: or I should say, can you get this to work in a MPZues enviroment? It works well in singleplayer still.
10:05 - Tajin: oh that one
10:05 - Tajin: never tried it in mp but yeh, should be doable
10:06 - Tajin: if all else fails, I can just write my own version of it
10:09 - Sabre One: Yea it would be nice, Tanoa offers some pretty good chances for water borne missions, but diving is limited due to the inability to set charges.
10:09 - Tajin: initServer.sqf <--- do you have that file ?
10:09 - Tajin: if not, make one and add this:
10:09 - Tajin: fnc_handleCuratorVisibility = {
private["_gather"];
_gather = allUnits + vehicles;
{
if (player countEnemy [_x] isEqualTo 1) then {
if (!isObjectHidden) then {
_x hideObject true;
curHiddenObjects pushBack _x;
};
};
} count _gather;

waitUntil {sleep 1; isNull findDisplay 312};
{
_x hideObject false;
} count curHiddenObjects
};
publicVariable "fnc_handleCuratorVisibility";

{
_x addEventHandler ["BIS_fnc_curatorObjectRegistered", {
params["_cur","_list"];
private["_player"];
_player = getAssignedCuratorUnit _x;
[] remoteExec ["fnc_handleCuratorVisibility",_player];
}];
} count allCurators;
10:09 - Tajin: or actually... hang on
10:10 - Tajin: http://rising.at/projekte/ArmA/initServer.sqf
10:10 - Tajin: there
10:10 - Tajin: havent tested it yet. so it could go horribly wrong ...
10:10 - Tajin: but in theory
10:11 - Sabre One: whats it do?
10:11 - Tajin: it should hide every hostile unit when you enter zeus mode
10:11 - Tajin: and make them visible again, when you leave it
10:11 - Sabre One: ow, well I probably won't mess with that right away. It's in the future plan though.
10:12 - Tajin: it doesnt account for units that are added afterwards though
10:12 - Tajin: yeh
10:12 - Sabre One: I'll save the script for later.
10:12 - Tajin: i'll put it on my todo list anyway
10:12 - Tajin: its an interesting idea
10:12 - Tajin: maybe I can improve it further
10:12 - Sabre One: The concept for me in my head is to say have a "officer" slot in the teams
10:13 - Sabre One: that officer slot can control larger groups of units, or take other units under his/her wing. Allowing for sorta a 3rd tier command slot .
10:14 - Tajin: in theory it would even be possible to hide only enemys that are not visible to any friendly units
10:14 - Tajin: but that might be a resource itensive
10:14 - Tajin: I remember an addon that did something similar for thirdperson view
10:15 - Tajin: where it allowed thirdperson  but hid any enemies that you didnt have direct line of sight to
10:16 - Sabre One: Yea, well so far I think aside from that diving script. The remaining stuff with be polish.
10:16 - Sabre One: I think you like the end result in all honesty. It opens up a ton of mission options that put more on the players actions and leaves zues free on other things naturally.
10:17 - Tajin: diving script ?
10:17 - Sabre One: the one I just posted, for placing bombs.
10:18 - Tajin: oh, thats not specific for diving
10:18 - Sabre One: True, I just think more for it in terms of expanding mission possiblity.
10:22 - Tajin: sure
10:23 - Tajin: certainly a useful feature
10:23 - Tajin: ace has that too
10:23 - Tajin: but I guess youre aiming for a mod-free environment
10:23 - Sabre One: It won't be forever, just starting out as such. I don't think I'll use ACE though.
10:24 - Sabre One: My main goal is quality. I seen to many servers slap 30 mods together and can't figure out why their server needs restarded every 6 hours.
10:28 - Tajin: true
10:28 - Tajin: same thing can easily happen with scripts though
10:29 - Tajin: some are not optimized at all
10:32 - Sabre One hat den Status gewechselt zu: Abwesend.
